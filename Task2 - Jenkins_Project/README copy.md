# Declarative vs Scripted Pipelines
# Declarative Pipeline 
More structured and opinionated syntax

Built-in validation and error handling
Uses pipeline block structure

# Scripted Pipeline

More flexible but complex
Uses Groovy scripting directly
Wrapped in node blocks
Better for complex logic and conditionals
